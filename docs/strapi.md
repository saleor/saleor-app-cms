# Strapi

## Configuration

Strapi integration requires several configuration tokens. You should enter them in the _Apps -> CMS Hub_ configuration view.

Here is the list of the tokens and instructions on how to obtain them

- `baseUrl`: the API URL. It's the address of your Strapi API. For local Strapi development it will be: `http://localhost:XXXX`.
- `token`: the authorization token. For instructions on how to create one for CMS Hub, please go to the [Strapi "Managing API tokens" documentation](https://docs.strapi.io/user-docs/latest/settings/managing-global-settings.html#managing-api-tokens).
